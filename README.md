# ðŸ§¨ Inngest Overload

A load testing tool for Inngest queues built with Express and TypeScript. This application allows you to generate configurable workloads to test queue performance, concurrency limits, and system behavior under different loads.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: Modern dark-themed dashboard for easy load testing (I vibe coded this ðŸ¤˜)
- **Configurable Workloads**: Control queue size, duration, CPU usage, and concurrency
- **Real-time Feedback**: See results and responses immediately
- **Inngest Integration**: Built specifically for testing Inngest queue systems

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Inngest CLI for development

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndyInternet/inngest-overload
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd inngest-overload
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the TypeScript files:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the Inngest dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run inngest
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Use the web interface to configure and trigger your load tests with:
   - **Number of Events**: How many events to queue (1-1,000,000)
   - **Run Duration**: How long each event should run (100-600,000ms)
   - **CPU Usage**: Light or Heavy CPU-bound processing
   - **Concurrency Limit**: 0 (no limit), 1 (single thread), 10 (limited), 25 (moderate), or 50 (high)
   - **Enable Steps**: Include steps in the event processing

### Option 2: API Endpoint

Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/trigger` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "toQueue": 50,
  "runDuration": 1000,
  "cpuUsage": "heavy",
  "concurrencyLimit": 10,
  "steps": true
}
```

## API Reference

### POST /trigger

Triggers a configurable number of Inngest events for load testing.

**Request Body:**

- `toQueue` (number): Number of events to queue
- `runDuration` (number): Duration each event should run (ms)
- `cpuUsage` (string): "light" or "heavy" - CPU intensity level
- `concurrencyLimit` (number): 0, 1, 10, 25, or 50 - Max concurrent events
- `steps` (boolean): Include steps in the event processing

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "50 events sent",
  "runDuration": 1000,
  "cpuUsage": "heavy"
}
```
